This directory contains CI scripts and configuration that are used by both heptio's CI tools (for development work) and by Amazon's CI tools (for testing before the templates are written to the official `quickstart-examples` s3 bucket.)

config.yml is needed by Amazon's CI (for the https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-heptio repo), the rest of the files are used by heptio's CI directly (for the https://github.com/heptio/aws-quickstart repo.)
